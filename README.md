1. Getting Started with Create React App
========================================

This project was created in an attempt to get lotteries implimented into the crypto world and making the first official lottery website for crypto currencies.

This part of the project is the admin dashboard where you can view all contract information and you can itneract with the contract as well by pausing the contract/lottery (This stops all purchases of tickets) picking random winner, paying the winner and finalizing the lottery and transfering the remainder of the lottery to the Decentralized Lottery wallet. Then you can unpause it and get the lottery started again.

**Note** 
Only the owner of the contract can interact with the contract as a security measure. I have attempted to make sure that no one can interact with the contract and do main functions unless they are the owner of the contract. Even if someone was to be able access this page no one can do anything accept view details.
